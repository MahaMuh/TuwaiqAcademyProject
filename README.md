## About Dataset
Churn rate is a marketing term that measures how many customers abandon a company over a given time frame. Each user has a prediction value assigned to them that represents how likely they are to churn at any given moment. This number is determined, among other things, by 
the user's demographic data
browsing habits
and past purchases.
It takes into account our special and confidential projections of how long a user will stay a customer. All users that have at least one conversion have their score updated daily. The specified values range from 1 to 5.
